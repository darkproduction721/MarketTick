# Cursor Development Rules

## Data Integrity Requirements
- NEVER use dummy, placeholder, or mock data in development
- NEVER use bypassing methods, workarounds, or shortcuts that circumvent proper data handling
- ALWAYS use real, production-like data for all development and testing

## Implementation Standards
- All database queries must use actual data sources
- API calls must connect to real endpoints (staging/dev environments with real data)
- Form submissions and data processing must handle genuine data structures
- Authentication and authorization must use real user data and permissions

## Prohibited Practices
- No hardcoded values that simulate real data
- No skipping validation or security checks
- No using static responses instead of dynamic data fetching
- No placeholder content that doesn't reflect actual use cases

## Required Practices
- Use proper environment variables for different data sources
- Implement proper error handling for real data scenarios
- Test with actual data volumes and edge cases
- Validate data integrity at every step
- Maintain data consistency across all operations

## Code Quality
- Write code that works with real data constraints
- Handle actual data types, formats, and validation rules
- Account for real-world data variations and edge cases
- Implement proper data sanitization and security measures
